{"role": "user", "content": "###Instructions###\nYou work on entity recognition. You will be given an academic abstract from arXiv. Your task is to extract all entities related to machine learning tasks, datasets, methods and benchmarks.\n\nHere is the definition of each entity you will extract:\n- Datasets: a collection of data used to train, pretrain or fine-tune a machine learning model.\n- Methods: a machine learning model or algorithm. This also includes the type of model (e.g. transformer, CNN, RNN, etc.) and other relevant components like optimization algorithms, loss functions, etc.\n- Benchmarks: a metric used to evaluate a machine learning model.\n- Tasks: a machine learning task (e.g. classification, question answering, summarization, etc.).\n\n###Constraints###\n- You must extract any abbreviations or acronyms too and consider them as distinct entities. For example, if you see \"Large Language Models (LLM)\", you must extract \"Large Language Models\" and \"LLM\" as two distinct entities.\n\n###Context###\n{text}\n"}
